#Determine sponsorship power of individuals


#For each pol:
"""
Percentage of sponsored bills that are successful, as well as number of sucessful sponsored bills (both matter)
For each topic and in general

Do this for regular/primary sponsor (some may make larger influences in one rather than the other, but others both)

Compare that to average pass rate for party bills.



Also separate voting b/w party. Some sponsors may generate strong party support, but no bipartisan.
